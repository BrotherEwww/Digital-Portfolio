## Reflection using the STAR Technique

### **Situation**
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed an **Interview Skills** assessment on the MyClassroom (CPUT) platform. This activity aimed to evaluate my understanding of professional interview preparation, behaviour, and response techniques in workplace contexts.

### **Task**
The goal was to demonstrate my ability to prepare for interviews professionally, understand common interview structures, and apply the STAR/CAR methods to answer competency-based questions confidently. The assessment focused on both verbal and non-verbal communication, self-presentation, and structured responses.

### **Action**
I prepared by revising the course materials on:
- **Professional interview preparation**, including research on companies and role requirements.  
- **The STAR/CAR techniques** for structuring answers to behavioural and situational questions.  
- **Body language, tone, and professional etiquette** during interviews.  
- **Common interview questions** and effective response strategies.  

I then completed the online assessment, answering all questions carefully and applying the knowledge from class and practical exercises.

### **Result**
I achieved **100%**, showing that I fully understood the principles of effective interview preparation and execution. The result reflected my ability to structure responses clearly, maintain professionalism, and present myself confidently in interview scenarios.  
The assessment also reinforced my understanding of how preparation and structured communication influence interview success.

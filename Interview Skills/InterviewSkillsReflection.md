## Reflection using the STAR Technique

### **Situation**
As part of the Work Readiness component of Project Presentation 3, I completed an online assessment on Interview Skills through the CPUT MyClassroom platform. The activity aimed to evaluate my understanding of effective interview preparation, behaviour, and response techniques.

### **Task**
The goal was to demonstrate my ability to prepare for interviews professionally, understand common interview structures, and apply the STAR/CAR methods to answer competency-based questions confidently.

### **Action**
To prepare for the assessment, I reviewed materials on professional communication, researched best practices for job interviews, and practised framing responses using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).  
I then completed the online quiz, ensuring I applied what I had learned about body language, preparation, and how to effectively communicate achievements and skills during an interview.

### **Result**
I achieved **100%** for the Interview Skills assessment. This result confirmed my understanding of professional interview practices and boosted my confidence in applying these skills in real-world interview situations.  
The activity also improved my ability to reflect critically on how preparation, research, and structured communication can significantly impact interview success.

## Reflection using the STAR Technique

### **Situation**
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed a **Business Communication** assessment on the MyClassroom (CPUT) platform. This activity aimed to test my understanding of professional communication principles used in workplace settings.

### **Task**
The goal was to demonstrate my ability to identify appropriate communication methods, apply professional etiquette, and use formal business language in various contexts. The assessment focused on both verbal and non-verbal communication, tone, and workplace professionalism.

### **Action**
I prepared by revising the course materials on:
- The **purpose and importance** of business communication.  
- The **difference between formal and informal language**.  
- **Non-verbal communication cues**, such as tone, posture, and facial expressions.  
- **Email and video conferencing etiquette**, especially for remote workplaces.  

I then completed the online assessment, answering all questions carefully and applying the knowledge from class and previous assignments.

### **Result**
I achieved **100%**, showing that I fully understood the principles of effective business communication. The result reflected my ability to communicate professionally and adapt my tone to suit various workplace scenarios.  
The only minor error was an initial incorrect selection that I quickly corrected in the second attempt, which helped reinforce my understanding of virtual meeting etiquette.

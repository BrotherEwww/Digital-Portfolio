## Reflection using the STAR Technique

### **Situation**
As part of the Work Readiness programme for Project Presentation 3, I participated in a **mock interview** designed to simulate a real job interview scenario. The activity aimed to test my communication skills, confidence, and ability to present my technical and soft skills effectively to a potential employer.

### **Task**
The goal was to apply what I had learned from the Interview Skills module in a practical, real-life setting. I needed to demonstrate professional etiquette, clear communication, and the ability to answer both technical and behavioural questions confidently.

### **Action**
Before the interview, I prepared by:
- Reviewing common ICT-related interview questions.  
- Rehearsing answers using the **STAR technique** to structure my responses.  
- Dressing appropriately and maintaining professional body language.  
- Setting up a quiet and well-lit environment for the virtual session.  

During the interview, I greeted the interviewer politely, maintained eye contact, and answered each question with clarity and relevance. I also highlighted my teamwork, time management, and problem-solving skills with real examples from my coursework.

### **Result**
The mock interview went smoothly and provided valuable feedback on my strengths and areas for improvement. The interviewer commended my composure and confidence, particularly in describing technical skills.  
I realised the importance of preparation, active listening, and adapting my communication to suit the interview context. This exercise greatly enhanced my confidence for future real-world interviews.

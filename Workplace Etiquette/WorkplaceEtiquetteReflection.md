## Reflection using the STAR Technique

### **Situation**
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed a **Workplace Etiquette** assessment on the MyClassroom (CPUT) platform. This activity focused on understanding appropriate behaviour, communication, and professionalism in a work environment.

### **Task**
The goal was to demonstrate my knowledge of professional conduct, including time management, confidentiality, and respectful communication. The assessment also tested my awareness of how personal actions reflect on professionalism within the ICT workplace.

### **Action**
I prepared by reviewing the course material on:  
- The **importance of punctuality** and respecting work schedules.  
- **Handling confidential information** responsibly.  
- **Email and communication etiquette** when dealing with colleagues and clients.  
- **Appropriate use of personal devices** during work hours.  
- The correct procedure for requesting time off or leaving work early.  

I then completed the online assessment, applying these principles to each question to ensure my answers reflected real-world professional standards.

### **Result**
I achieved **100%**, showing that I fully understood workplace expectations and professional behaviour. This result confirmed my readiness to act ethically and responsibly in professional settings. The experience helped reinforce my understanding of maintaining integrity, punctuality, and respect in all workplace interactions.

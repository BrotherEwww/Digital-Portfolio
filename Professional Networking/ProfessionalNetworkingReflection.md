## Reflection using the STAR Technique

### **Situation**
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed a **Professional Networking** assessment on the MyClassroom (CPUT) platform. The activity aimed to evaluate my understanding of how to build and maintain professional connections both online and in person.

### **Task**
The goal was to demonstrate my ability to identify the purpose of professional networking, understand common networking practices, and recognise mistakes to avoid when interacting with professionals in the ICT field.

### **Action**
I prepared by revising the course material on:  
- The **purpose and benefits** of professional networking.  
- The **different types of networking events** and their relevance to ICT careers.  
- The **“golden rule” of networking**, which is to offer value before expecting it.  
- **Common mistakes** to avoid, such as failing to follow up or not being authentic.  

I then completed the online assessment, carefully reading each question and applying what I had learned about professional behaviour, relationship-building, and effective communication in networking scenarios.

### **Result**
I achieved **100%**, showing that I fully understood the key principles of professional networking. The result reflected my ability to apply effective networking strategies and maintain professionalism in all interactions. The initial incorrect selection on my first attempt helped reinforce the importance of preparation and continuous learning.
